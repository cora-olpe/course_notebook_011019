# Introduction 

We thought we could look at the size distribution of partials to get an idea about potential contributions of TA cells to stem cell clones. eg to test the **N + 1 hypothesis** [^1]  

[^1]: Which we have never tested before

## Scoring partials {#ID1}

To look at partials we need to score them. We do this in eights. Here are some example pictures of this.

However, this is not an intestinal crypt

## the data {#ID3}

We scored a number of partials for different marks

| mark | clones scored |
|------|---------------|
| MAOA | 169           |
| HDAC6| 145           |
| STAG2| 198           |

3.[HDAC6](#ID3)
