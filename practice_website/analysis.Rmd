```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#this bit is invisible
library(tidyverse)
my_data <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv")

```

## Now let's display some stuff

Let's plot the population of different countries.

```{r include=FALSE}
population <- my_data%>%
  select(-continent, - lifeExp, -gdpPercap, -year)

```
```{r echo=FALSE}
population%>%
  ggplot(mapping=(aes(x=country, y=pop))) + geom_point()

```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
